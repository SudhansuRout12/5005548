Q)Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.
A)A recursive function solves a particular problem by calling a copy of itself and solving smaller subproblems of the original problems. Many more recursive calls can be generated as and when required. It is essential to know that we should provide a certain case in order to terminate this recursion process.
Base Case: The condition under which the recursion terminates. This prevents infinite recursion and allows the function to return a result directly without further recursive calls.
Recursive Case: The part where the function calls itself with a modified argument, gradually working towards the base case.

How Recursion Simplifies Problems:-
1.Breaking Down Problems: Recursion simplifies complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subproblems. Each recursive call works on a smaller subset of the problem, often mirroring the original problem's structure.
2.Natural Fit for Certain Problems: Some problems have a natural recursive structure, such as tree traversals, factorial calculation, and Fibonacci sequences. Recursive solutions are often more intuitive and easier to implement for such problems.
3.Simplified Code: Recursive solutions can lead to more concise and readable code compared to iterative solutions. For example, problems involving hierarchical data or nested structures  are often easier to solve using recursion.
4.Ease of Implementation: Recursive algorithms can simplify the implementation of algorithms that involve repeated application of the same logic, such as divide-and-conquer algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quicksort).





Q)Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.
A)The time complexity of the 'calculateFutureValue' method is O(n) where n is the number of years. Each recursive call involves a constant amount of work, and the total work done is directly proportional to the number of recursive calls made.





Q)Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.
A)To optimize the recursive solution for calculating the future value and avoid excessive computation, you can use tail recursion.
1.Tail Recursion Optimization
-Tail Recursion Concept: Tail recursion occurs when the recursive call is the last operation in the function. This allows the compiler or interpreter to optimize the recursion, reusing the current functionâ€™s stack frame for the next function call, thus avoiding additional stack usage.
2.Optimization in 'calculateFutureValue': Convert the recursive function into a tail-recursive version by passing an additional parameter to carry the intermediate results. This way, the recursive call becomes the last operation in the function.
